Future Improvements for Testing Framework
1.Advanced Test Cases
  -Implement test cases that cover edge cases, boundary conditions, and error scenarios for more comprehensive test coverage.
2.Performance Testing
  -Incorporate performance test cases to evaluate the application's speed, scalability, and stability under varying loads.
3.CI/CD Integration (TeamCity/Jenkins)
  -Automate the testing process by integrating it into CI/CD pipelines with TeamCity or Jenkins to run tests automatically on every code change.
4.Selenium Grid with Docker for Multi-Browser/Container Testing
  -Utilize Selenium Grid in Docker containers to run tests concurrently across multiple browsers and environments for faster execution.
5.Cross-Browser Testing
  -Ensure application compatibility across various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) using Selenium .
6.Testing Across Multiple Devices and Resolutions
  -Validate the application's responsiveness by testing on various devices and screen resolutions, leveraging CSS media queries for design adaptation.
7.Mobile Testing Automation
  -Automate mobile app testing for Android and iOS using Appium or similar tools, with Docker integration for parallel test execution on multiple devices.
8.Load Testing with Neoload/JMeter
  -Generate and execute load test scripts with tools like Neoload or JMeter to simulate real-world usage and assess system performance under heavy load.
9.Integration with Monitoring Tools
  -Integrate performance tests with monitoring tools like Grafana, AWS CloudWatch, or New Relic to track system health, performance, and real-time alerts.
10.Metrics and Reporting
  -Set up a dashboard to provide real-time reporting on key metrics such as test success rates, code coverage, and performance trends, enabling better decision-making and faster issue resolution.
